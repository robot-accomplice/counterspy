## Tick 1 (cp-1, plan Task 1: shared model) — resolved 2026-07-08

- **A. Subject.Key() collision** (QA F-1 + Audit F-1, high/high, cross-reviewer + orchestrator-verified):
  FIX-NOW. Namespace the key: `"path:"+Path` vs `"pid:"+itoa(PID)`. No vote (unanimous).
- **B. pid:0 collapse** (QA F-2, high/single-reviewer): DEFER. Justification: only kernel_task is PID 0,
  which is Apple-signed + SIP-protected and never quarantined; collectors always emit a real PID or a
  Path. Documented as an invariant on Subject; ticket T-1 tracks hardening if that invariant is ever
  violated by a collector. (Rule 16: deferred on real-world-risk grounds, not silently dropped.)
- **C. Undocumented Path/PID precedence** (Audit F-2, med/med): FOLD into A — add doc comment.
- **D. ActionKind enum** (Audit F-3, low/med): DEFER to Task 11. Justification: sole consumer is
  act.Quarantine (unbuilt); introduce the typed enum alongside its consumer and update the plan in one
  stroke. Ticket T-2.
- **E. Finding/ManifestItem duplication** (Audit F-4, low/low): WON'T-FIX — plan intends phase separation.
